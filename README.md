## Receipt Extraction API

A FastAPI-based application that extracts text from scanned PDF receipts using Tesseract OCR and stores the data in an SQLite database.

Why FastAPI?

We chose FastAPI because it makes building APIs in Python quick and efficient. It automatically handles request validation, error responses, and interactive documentation, which saves a lot of development time. With its support for modern Python features like type hints, it's easier to write clean and reliable code. FastAPI is also really fast in terms of performance, making it a great choice for production ready APIs.
